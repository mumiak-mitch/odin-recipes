            <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender.
            </li>
            <li>Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the
                blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get
                the
                soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.
                Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; stir in flour and add
                milk.
                Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
